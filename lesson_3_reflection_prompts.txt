When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

the remote is more user friendly.
the best practice would be smth like this. Create a remote and pull to local. lots of ppl 
pull to local and start working on diff section of code. when someone finishes, they push 
the changes to the remote. Even if they haven't finished, they can pull to update their code.
But this somehow intersects with what a branch does. Well, there is also the bonus of no internet
connection to work on local. you can also merge in local and test before merging in remote.
