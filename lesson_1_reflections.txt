How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    A bug is most likely created when you introduced new lines of code, the 
    difference between the two versions most likely contain the bug introduced

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    It helps to compare diff versions of a file to look for bugs

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Manual is more flexible, automatic saves most likely not run. For non executable
    files google docs is good, for programming manual is better.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Files in google docs are not related to each other. Files in Git that call
    each other will probably change at the same time, and thus must be tracked
    together.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    git log let you see all commits. Each commit has a id, date and comment.
    One done that, if you want to compare two commits you use the id and git diff.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    there is less fear in doing changes because you can go back to previous working
    versions inmediatly.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    all my projects of course
